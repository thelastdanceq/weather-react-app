Technologies that I used and for what : 
1) weather API          : to grab the data about weather, forecast , quality of air etc(https://www.weatherapi.com/);
2) custom hook          : useLocalStorage - to overwrite data in local storage;
3) context , useContext : to storage global states like : city and time ; 


What i learned and practiced during the pet project : 

- lots of detail of adaptive apps ; 

How i can upgrade it : 
- refactor the code 
- add chart of today temperature
